# Michael J. Komnick
I'm Michael Komnick, a computer science student at the University of the South (C'24). I'm also the current assistant director of [Sewanee DataLab](https://new.sewanee.edu/sewanee-datalab/). Welcome to my GitHub page!

## GitHub Organizations
* [Sewanee DataLab](https://github.com/sewaneedata)

## Work Projects
* [Student Well-being Dashboard](https://github.com/sewaneedata/wellbeing/wiki) - This is an interactive public dashboard that displays Sewanee student well-being trends and statistics. It was made during my Sewanee DataLab 2022 summer fellowship.

## Class Projects
* [Survive The Students](https://github.com/LordOfTimeLords64/Game-SurviveTheStudents) - This is the source code and files for a video game I made in my CSCI 276 course (Multimedia Programming & Design). It was made using Processing, a flexible software sketchbook that uses Java.
* [Rate My Dorm](https://github.com/LordOfTimeLords64/rate-my-dorm) - Rate My Dorm is my final project for CSCI 284 (Database Design with Web Applications). It was a website that allowed students to rate dorms at the University of the South (Sewanee). Users can create an account to rate dorms, ask and answer questions about dorms, and provide comments about their ratings.
* [Space Cowboy 2D Platformer](https://github.com/Yosenky/Space-Cowboy-2D-Platformer) - This is a video game for my Game Development with Unity independent study. My main contribution was adding enemy pathfinding using the [A* Pathfinding Project](https://arongranberg.com/astar/#)
* [Flerpy Derp](https://github.com/LordOfTimeLords64/FlerpyDerp) - This is another video game I made during my Game Development with Unity independent study. It is my take on Flappy Bird.
